# stocks-analysis
## Overview
### Background
Steve loves the workbook prepared for him. At the click of a button, 
he can analyze an entire dataset. 
Now, to do a little more research for his parents, 
he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. 
Although the code works well for a dozen stocks, 
it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

### Purpose
The purpost of this project is to determine whether refactoring a code will successfully make the VBA script run faster.
When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more 
efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or 
improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.
